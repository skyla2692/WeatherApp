# Weather App

Making a weather application using React Native. <br>
Following basic instructions from the [lecture](http://nomadcoders.co/react-native-for-beginners) of Nomad Coders community. <br>

This application will be a combination of weather forecast and to-do application. <br>
The api key is not included in .gitignore because it is free to get it. <br>
